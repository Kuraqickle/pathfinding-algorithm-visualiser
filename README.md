# pathfinding-algorithm-visualiser

This project is an interactive tool that shows how pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra’s, A*, and Depth-First Search work. You can create a grid, set a starting point and an endpoint, add walls as obstacles, and watch the algorithm find the shortest path in real-time. It’s a fun way to explore and understand how these algorithms navigate through spaces.

To use it, simply click on the grid to place the start and end points, draw walls, and choose an algorithm. Then hit the run key to see it in action. You can reset the grid at any time to experiment with different layouts or algorithms.

To get started, clone the repository, install Pygame with pip install pygame, and run the script with Python.
